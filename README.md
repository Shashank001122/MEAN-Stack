Personal MEAN stack Website

This website is my portfolio website. I've used MEAN stack to develop it.
Also, I used Angular's Google Material and BootStrap for Design

1) To start the project, download and run ng serve from Angular cli
2) To start the server, use node server.js after entering backend folder(cd backend)
3) Make sure you have an account on MongoDB's Atlas and change the parameter in environment.prod.ts accordingly.
4) Use npm install to install any missing dependecies(like missing node_modules package)
